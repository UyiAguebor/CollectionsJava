### Activity

1.
    a) Write a program to create an array list, add some colors (strings) and print out the collection.</br>

    b) Retrieve an element (at a specified index) from the array list. Update this element to a new colour.</br>

    c) Clone your array list to another array list. Sort alphabetically.

2.
    a) Write a program to create a linked list, add some cities and iterate through the collection.</br>

    b) Iterate through in reverse order.</br>

    c) Retrieve, but not remove, the last element of the list.</br>

    d) Remove and return the first element of the list.</br>

    e) Replace one of the cities in the list with a different city.

3.
    a) Write a program to create a hash set, add some technology brand names and return the size of the collection.</br>

    b) Write a program to convert the set to a tree set.</br>

    c) Find brands in the set with fewer than 7 characters.</br>

    d) Test if the hash set is empty, then compare if the hash set and tree set are equal.

    e) Retrieve and remove the first element of each set.

4.
    a) Write a program to create a hash map, add the names and values of some mathematical constants and return their values.</br>

    b) Write a test to see if the constant, *e*, exists in the map.

    c) Sort the map by size of the constants.</br>

    d) Copy the contents of the hash map into a tree map.

    e) Sort the keys in the tree map by using a comparator.

    f) Remove the value of a specific element.

    g) Change the sign of all values (+ve to -ve and vice versa).
